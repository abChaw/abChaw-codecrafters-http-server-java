protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your HTTP server implementation is in
`src/main/java/Main.java`. 

# Stage 2 & beyond
1. Ensure you have `mvn` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main/java/Main.java`.
